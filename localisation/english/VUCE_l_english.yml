 VUCE_navy_rework_welcome_splash_tab_5: "UTTNH Patch"
 VUCE_navy_rework_welcome_splash_tab_5_content: "§HUTTNH+VNR Compatibility Pack: Neo 1.8 alpha§!\n\nSupported Versions:\nVanilla Naval Rework (VNR): v2.8 \"Battle of Leyte Gulf\" (2026.1.1)\nUTTNH: 2026.1.11 (UTC+8)\n\n§RWARNING: Alpha version. Not fully tested.§!\nExpect balance issues, missing textures, or UI overflows when using VUCE Cold War content.\n\nVNR+UTTNH Extended Content (VUCE) introduces significant changes to VNR. This tab provides a quick overview of these modifications.\n\n§YNaval Combat & Defense§!\nVUCE Cold War stats are unique compared to Vanilla/VNR:\n- Light Attack represents all non-missile/torpedo fire.\n- Heavy Attack is treated as Missile Attack.\n- Armor: Missile-capable ships gain massive armor bonuses. Conventional cannons will struggle to pierce them, dealing minimal damage.\n- Missiles: Anti-ship missiles possess terrifying damage and piercing, lethal to both modern and legacy hulls.\n\n§YAmphibious Assault Ships (LHA)§!\nLHA units feature extreme Light Attack stats, providing massive Shore Bombardment bonuses.\n- Max Shore Bombardment cap increased to 80% specifically for LHA.\n- Note: LHA Light Piercing is 0; they deal only 1% damage to other warships.\n\n§YCold War Carriers§!\nThese titans possess immense HP and Organization (1000+), making them nearly unsinkable even against missiles. However, their cost (30,000+) is prohibitive.\n- Deck Space: Since HOI4 lacks \"aircraft size\" logic, carrier capacity scales upwards regardless of plane type. \n- Strategy: Late-WWII carriers remain the most cost-effective choice. Building overpriced Cold War Supercarriers is a matter of prestige and late-game power.\n\n§YCold War Missile Ships§!\nFrigates, Destroyers, Cruisers, and Battleships all have missile variants.\n- Frigates: Limited to Light Anti-Ship Missiles.\n- Destroyers: Late-tier hulls can equip Heavy Missiles.\n- Cruisers/BBs: Can equip all missile types.\n\n§YNew Production Interface§!\nVUCE integrates a widened ship production UI (inherited from SCW) to fix display issues when exceeding 12 ship types.\n\n§RDevelopment Status: Incomplete§!\nCold War missile ships, submarines, and other content are still under development.\nMaintaining a compatibility patch is taxing. Unlike standalone Mod authors who only worry about Paradox updates, I must update whenever VNR or UTTNH changes. I will continue to maintain this, but update speed is not guaranteed. \n\nNote: Icons and UI assets are inherited from my unreleased project \"SCW\".\n\nKnown Issues:\n- Task Force UI overflows with too many ship types.\n- Naval Statistics screen cannot display all categories.\n- Task Force Editor may exceed screen bounds in large fleets.\n\n§RThis tab is added by the Compatibility Pack and is not part of the base VNR mod. \"I/Me\" refers to the patch author.§!\nTranslated by Goodle Gemini."

 VUCE_coldwar_landing_craft_2: "Amphibious Assault Ship"
 VUCE_coldwar_landing_craft_2_desc: "The improvised transport ships and landing crafts of the World War II era are no longer sufficient for the demands of modern warfare. The first generation of purpose-built Amphibious Assault Ships marks a turning point in naval landing operations, moving from 'makeshift solutions' toward 'systemic integration.' By incorporating well decks, vehicle decks, and basic command facilities, these vessels allow troops, armored vehicles, and landing crafts to be deployed collectively from a single platform, coordinating landing actions under offshore conditions. Although their aviation and defensive capabilities remain limited, the advent of the Amphibious Assault Ship ensures that large-scale transoceanic landings no longer rely on converted vessels, laying the foundation for more multi-dimensional and long-range amphibious operations in the future."
